# React Bootstrap Datatable

[![minzipped size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/react-bs-datatable)](https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-bs-datatable) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-bs-datatable.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-bs-datatable) [![downloads per week](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/react-bs-datatable)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bs-datatable)

Inspired by [react-data-components](https://github.com/carlosrocha/react-data-components). This library uses [react-bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/) stylesheets and javascripts. In addition, this library also uses [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for the table header, clear filter, and other stuffs.

This is the v3 version of the library. To see the v2 version of README, please visit the [v1 branch](https://github.com/imballinst/react-bs-datatable/tree/v1).

## What's new in v3?

- New build and publish system. Previously, this library used Webpack for bundling etc.â€”now it only uses `tsc` to compile the TypeScript files to output all files to the `lib` folder.
- ESM and CommonJS are now supported. There are 2 new TypeScript configurations in the project, one is used for building ESM and the other is for building CommonJS.
- Updated Storybook. Previously, this library still used `storiesOf`, but now it is using Component Story Format (CSF), which was available starting from Storybook v5.
- Lots of optimizations, bundle size in particular. As reported by [Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-bs-datatable@3.0.0-alpha.6) for the Alpha version, the minified size is down to just a quarter of what it was, whereas the minified + gzip is down to a third of what it was.
- Replaced `font-awesome` CSS with the [React components of Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react). This allowed us to enable tree shaking, which resulted in the optimization point above.
- Drop support for all other libraries. This library will now only support Bootstrap tables.
- Auto generate component APIs.

## Usage

For more complete examples, please visit this sandbox link (https://codesandbox.io/s/react-bs-datatable-3-typescript-bn234b) or the Storybook demo (https://imballinst.github.io/react-bs-datatable).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  DatatableWrapper,
  Filter,
  Pagination,
  PaginationOpts,
  TableBody,
  TableHeader
} from 'react-bs-datatable';
import { Col, Row, Table } from 'react-bootstrap';

import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

// Create table headers consisting of 4 columns.
const headers = [
  { title: 'Username', prop: 'username' },
  { title: 'Name', prop: 'realname' },
  { title: 'Location', prop: 'location' }
];

// Randomize data of the table columns.
// Note that the fields are all using the `prop` field of the headers.
const body = Array.from(new Array(57), () => {
  const rd = (Math.random() * 10).toFixed(1);

  if (rd > 0.5) {
    return {
      username: 'i-am-billy',
      realname: `Billy ${rd}`,
      location: 'Mars'
    };
  }

  return {
    username: 'john-nhoj',
    realname: `John ${rd}`,
    location: 'Saturn'
  };
});

// Then, use it in a component.
function TableComponent() {
  return (
    <DatatableWrapper body={body} headers={headers}>
      <Row className="mb-4">
        <Col
          xs={12}
          lg={4}
          className="d-flex flex-col justify-content-end align-items-end"
        >
          <Filter />
        </Col>
        <Col
          xs={12}
          sm={6}
          lg={4}
          className="d-flex flex-col justify-content-lg-center align-items-center justify-content-sm-start mb-2 mb-sm-0"
        >
          <PaginationOpts />
        </Col>
        <Col
          xs={12}
          sm={6}
          lg={4}
          className="d-flex flex-col justify-content-end align-items-end"
        >
          <Pagination />
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <Table>
        <TableHeader />
        <TableBody />
      </Table>
    </DatatableWrapper>
  );
}
